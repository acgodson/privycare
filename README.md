PrivyStore is an experimental project that sprung up during the Paris EthCC hack 2022. Join us as we explore the possibilites of building a secure and open web3  marketplace

## About PrivyCare Project

**Privycare** is a web3-inspired healthcare insurance marketplace where users can sign up with their Ethereum wallet and have direct, unlimited access to book appointments with their healthcare  provider or doctor.

Primarily we want to allow end-users and creators (health-care providers) to securely store personal information and exchange appointments off-chain utilizing Privy. 

For our MVP, when a user secures an appointment on front-end, some notification or add-to-calendar link is forwarded to both parties' encrypted emails from the privy-node.
